I had originally written an application in Go that allowed users to install a UserScript in their browser and see when other users were typing messages and how far they had read.

Unfortunately, for various technical reasons, the program started running into some rather serious technical issues. Rather than trying to fight my way through (what appears to be) a very difficult and unforgiving websocket package, I decided to rewrite the entire thing in C++ with Qt. This is that project.
